"what's the big picture?"; lab4 = phishing
Why localhost, not IP? Because grader has different IP.

11x worm & replication
10x what is/why content sniffing?
 - incorrect file endings
 - why HTML specifically?
 - how does executable code in images work?
 - why not just have executable/non-executable?
7x use console (Firebug not necessary)
6x race-condition (need to wait for transfer req to complete)
6x what is a "scanner"? automated tools for finding vuln in JS?
 - Grabber, Vega, ZAP, SQLMap, ...
5x why not just better browser protection?
 - Why not remove bad features (backward compatability)
 - Different browser = different security? Yes!
 - Cross-frame things hard in modern browsers:
   - XSS protection (only reflected)
   - httponly cookies
   - X-Frame-Options
   - HSTS
   - CSP
   - SRI (load JS from CDN)
5x SOP bypass (information still allowed?)
 - Allowed to load resources from remote origin, but can't view content
 - Remote scripts/styles are still evaluated!
 - = "Side-channel" (another 5x)
5x how to avoid URL showing up (+ challenge = another injection)
 - <iframe>s
 - for challenge, XSS without changing URL?
4x do frameworks mean don't have to think about sec?
4x Firefox on Ubuntu 12.04 vs other Firefox
 - Reference images (from PhantomJS) are what count, manual checks in Firefox
 - Any Firefox likely to work fine, but should check in VM
3x form + iframe
 - target=""
3x Stored XSS vs reflected XSS
2x e-mail script; "javascript:void((new Image())"

2x how to inject JS code without editing files?
2x OWASP 10 actually used? could these attacks be used in the wild?
2x "prefix URLs"
2x how to hide tracks? can't sender tell that they lose money?
2x {{ }} in templates (general flask temp. syntax)
2x protection against these attacks?
"Cancel" outstanding requests (#11)

DB queries from terminal?
csrf useful unless controlling big site?
famous examples of these exploits?
csrf - just read token (no, SOP. yes if XSS). also, not *instead* of cookies!
how to give attacker money? transfer?
how is 12 not trivial? i.e. why would use be confused after submitting form that intercepts and sniffs user/pass?
CSRF = SOP bypass? (no, iframe is just to hide, could do without)
What is "file:///"? Flow of grader?
"Forward login?"
cookie sufficient for impersonation?
why are third-party cookies bad?
DNS rebinding
"why is profile worm named worm?"
why not SOP for paths?
can you detect where submit of form comes from?
attacker sniff browser-stored credentials?
is sanitization enough for XSS?
why does e-mail not have MIME content problems?
Unvalidated redirects
Character set handling
OWASP 10 - all seem similar?
OWASP 10 - vary depending on sector?
OWASP 10 - Insecure Direct Object References = not check auth?
OWASP 10 - Why not DoS? Not a vuln!
BOM still a problem?
Why still IE? Especially IE6?
best way to create CAPTCHA
why meta with MIME in disks on file?
parent window vs child window permissions
VPN sufficient to protect against internal network attacks?
content sniffing a problem for AJAX?

diagrams?
"How can we tell that the server is executing our code?"
difference between server on a local network and deploy globally
hiding tracks = "who the attacker is"?
white-list vs black-list
all attacks done in JS?
protect against alert() show cookie??
synchronize network requests for CSRF???
XSS remote execution??
OWASP 10 - privilege separation == sec misconfiguration? (no, former is a *tool*)
serialization failures??
2x prohibited ports (XMLHttpRequest only to set ports)
"allow all websites to access any arbitrary file on client's computer?" ??
remote method calls between client and server = RPC??
